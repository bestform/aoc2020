AdventOfCode 2020
=================

This year my goal is to learn some Rust using AOC. I Don't know how much time I'll find but there we go.

Don't judge me by the code you find here. It is all a learning experience, and I am not trying to start with the most idiomatic Rust code from the very beginning, but to experiment and improve over time. ;)
